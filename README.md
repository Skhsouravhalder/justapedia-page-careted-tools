About: Justapedia Page Created Tools
By Sourav Halder

Hi, Iâ€™m Sourav Halder, and Iâ€™ve developed a tool called Justapedia Page Created Tools to help track and analyze the article creation activity of any user on Justapedia.

ðŸ”§ How the Tool Works
User Input
To begin, simply enter the username of the person whose contributions you want to track.

Namespace Selection
You can choose between two namespace options:

Main Namespace: Displays all regular articles created by the user in the main namespace.

All Namespaces: Includes everything â€” such as templates, modules, talk pages, and more â€” providing a complete overview of all contributions across all namespaces.

Date Range
To get accurate results, you can specify the start date or year from which to begin tracking. This allows you to focus on a specific timeframe.

User Info Integration
If you're unsure about when the user registered, Iâ€™ve also created a User Info user script thatâ€™s available on Justapedia.
This script shows key details such as the userâ€™s registration date, so you can easily determine the appropriate starting point for your analysis.

Using these tools together, you can generate a complete and detailed view of the pages and contributions made by any Justapedia user â€” from the day they joined up to the current date.
